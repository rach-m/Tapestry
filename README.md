I got my degree in graphic design, and colors/design have always spoke to me. I wanted to take that and translate it into a game. Tapestry is an intersection of design and coding. The sleek modern layout is combined with the game logic behind to create a fun game. Some issues I ran into included working with alerts inside of loops and creating a timer which I had never done before. There are two unsolved problems both concerning alerts. One is how to keep the zero of the timer on screen and have only one alert go off. The other is that when the user clicks check my answer, and they are incorrect then the game alerts them of their loss twice. I went into this working through some of the basic design before focusing on the logic which helped because I needed to be able to see what the logic was accomplishing.
