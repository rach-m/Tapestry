I got my degree in graphic design, and colors/design have always spoke to me. I wanted to take that and translate it into a game. Tapestry is an intersection of design and coding. The sleek modern layout is combined with the game logic behind to create a fun game. Some issues I ran into included working with alerts inside of loops and creating a timer which I had never done before. There is an unsolved problem of how to keep the zero of the timer on screen and have only one alert go off. I went into this working through some of the basic design before focusing on the logic which helped because I needed to be able to see what the logic was accomplishing.
